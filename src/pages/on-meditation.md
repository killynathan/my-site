I've heard tons of people recommend meditation and explain it's benefits, so I figured it's definitely something I need to try. However, being the overthinker that I am, I want to at least spend a little time researching to justify why this is worth my time before I start. Maybe meditating will even help me not overthink things!

## What is Meditation

First thing is first: What is meditation? This video puts it very simply:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkoOCw_tp1I

Meditation is **not** about forcing your brain be absolutely empty. You cannot block thought and emotion. Rather, meditation is about not listening to your "monkey mind". Your "monkey mind" is the constant chatter going on in your brain. Instead, we want to be an observer of our "monkey mind".

Now, how do we do stop succumbing to our "monkey mind"? There are many ways, but the simplest and most widely used method is simply being aware of your breath. Anytime you mind wanders and you cease to be aware of your breath, dont stress! Just being your attention back to the breath.

## Benefits

Accordind to my research, there are almost too many benefits to count. In just these two videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw71zanwMnY, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAVPDYhW_nw) we have:

1. Control Impulses
2. Improve concentration
3. More aware of everything from conversations to your surroundings
4. Enjoy the present more
5. Lower anxiety & depression & increase pain tolerance
6. Improve memory, self awareness, & goal setting
7. Increase empathy
8. Brains physically changing to be be better at learning, memory, & emotion.
9. Brains also physically changing to lower stress, blood pressure, & fear.
10. Increase immune function
11. Better at combatting cancer, diabetes, & cardiovascular disease.

Wowza, that's a lot of benefits. It almost seems too good to be true, which is why a big challenge is identifying what the benefits are **for me** and not just what I read online. I hope to be as open minded as possible and be able to focus on just meditation and not on the benefits.

## My Plan

I will be following the guided meditation from Sam Harris' app "Waking Up". This was recommended by Matt D'Avella and it seems really good from my initial screening.

And with that, my meditation adventure begins! I will either create a new post or update this one with the results. Is meditation overrated, overhyped, useless, enlightening, or life-changing? Find out next month!
