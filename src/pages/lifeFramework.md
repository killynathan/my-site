## Preface

- This framework should be evolving as a grow and learn.
- This is heavily influenced by Naval Ravikant.
- Left out a lot of things.
- Have to ask: Is the goal really worth it? Will I have a good life while I am doing these things?

## Goal

Acquire wealth, not money or status. Why do you want wealth? Hmmmmmm. One big thing will be financial freedom so that you can spend your time how you want to. Money frees you from having to do a specific thing at a specific time. Will it make you happy? Probably not. That's why you have to find joy in the journey.

## Goals

- Be an avid reader
- Be good at writing and speaking
- Build a habit of exercise
- Eat healthy
- Value your time (cut out time wasters)
- Be expert at something
- Have a base of knowledge: math, logic, persuasion, psych, game theory
- Meet very high quality people.

Now lets expands each of the goals.

## Be an avid reader

**Why**: Learn about the world. Gain insight. Not really sure besides that but it is **_heavily_** backed up by many "successful" people.

**How**: "Read What You Love Until You Love to Read".  
Start by reading what is easiest for you to read consistently.

**Specifics**: This means first reading fiction, fantasy, life story stuff, etc. Once you build the habit, move to harder and harder reads like nonfiction and deeper domain specfic things.

## Be good at writing and speaking

**Why**: The process of formalizing your thoughts into words so that the text is clear, concise, and convincing ensures mastery of the subject. Need to be a good communicator in all facets of life. This could help build a good reputation for you. This could help you be a better team player and leader. Don't do this to with the goal of building a reputation but rather from a place of generosity.

**Specifics**:

## Value your time

**Why**: Obvious.

**How**: Treat yourself like a CEO. This does not mean to inflate your ego and look down on others. This means valuing your time and making sure what you are doing is contributing to your future. Don't be a penny pincher or someone who stresses small things like using coupons. This definitely comes from a place of privilege, but you have to value your time at an extremely high rate. Try pretending your time is worth \$1000/h.

Practically, this includes:

- Simplify your eating. Cooking takes a lot of time. Eat out healthily or work with a meal prepping service.
- Minimize commute time. Listen to audiobooks & podcasts during commute.
- Don't be afraid to buy high quality things like a good laptop or a good noise canceling headphone.
- Instead of buying a used car, lease one instead if you aren't sure about commiting to a car.

This does not to mean to waste your money. Rather this is being smart with how you spend your money so that you are maximizing your time doing worthwhile things.

## Build a habit of exercise

Being in shape for looking as good as you an be is almost enough for this. However, the more important reason is that exercising helps your brain. Just go to the gym. Look into other activities like climbing if you cant do that. Just take a dam walk if you can't even do that.

## Be an expert at something

You want to double down at what you are a natural at. Don't forcefully pick something that you think will be the most profitable. I will seek to be an expert at software engineering. This is very ambitious but I will focus on simply what it takes to be a high level engineer at a big company. I also want to find something else that I can apply my computer skills to. This is maybe even more important and something I need to look into more. Being curious about the world and learning a lot through reading will help with this.

You should start with figuring out what you are really good at. Try some self-reflection or just ask people close to you.

## Work with high quality people

What do I mean by "high quality"?

- Intelligent
- Hard working / High energy
- High integrity
- Long term
- Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. their beliefs are self-fullfilling. Want rational optimists

## Each healthily

I want to live a long time, or have the choice of doing so.

# Business specific

- Want to leverage Network Effects.
  - Cach additional user adds value to all existing users
  - Leads to natural monopolies.
    - Think Facebook, languages, money
- "learn to build and learn to sell. if you do you will be unstoppable"

## People to study

The goal is not to idolize these people. Everyone has flaws. Learn to pick out the good parts and throw away the bad parts of everything you take in.

Use advice as hooks that you will one day remember and say "Oh thats what that person meant". Use advice to reinforce your own learnings.

These are all high profile people. I should look into lower profile people or people more personal. Also, don't aim to copy these people, **be authentic to yourself**.

- Steve Jobs
- Warren Buffet
- Bill Gates
- Benjamin Franklin
- Elon Musk
- Nassim Taleb

Now this is a lot of things to absorb, which is why building these things up as habits should not be rushed. Be consistent and deliberate in picking up these habits, and be patient with the results.

Important Disclaimer to all of this: what will gaining wealth do for you? Money can only solve your money problems.
Even with a ton of money, you will still be the same person. If you were happy then you'll be happy. If you were sad, then you'll still be sad.
"A calm mind, a fit body, and a household full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned."

Goal of money: You dont need to be at a particular place, at a particular time, doing something you don't want to do.
